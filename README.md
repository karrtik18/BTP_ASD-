# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of an individual having Autism Spectrum Disorder based on the AQ-10 screening questionnaire and other demographic data.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of the ASD dataset.
- Model training using the XGBoost algorithm.
- Achieved an accuracy of 97.87% on the test set.
- A simple web interface built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for ML utilities
- XGBoost for the classification model
- Streamlit for the web application
